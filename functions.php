 * shooting up, shooting each other, or just plain screwing their brains out 'cause they don't want 'em anymore.
 * I'm crazy? Honey, I'm the original one-eyed chicklet in the kingdom of the blind, 'cause at least I admit the
 * world makes me nuts. Name one person who can take it here. That's all I'm asking. Name one."
